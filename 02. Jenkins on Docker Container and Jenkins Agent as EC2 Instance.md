### First create a Jenkins Container that acts as a __Jenkins Controller__ Built-In Node:-

`docker run -d --name=my-jenkins -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins`

`docker logs -f <docker-container-id>`

Steps:

1. Go to chrome browser and then type http://localhost:8080
2. Then, take the Initial Password from the above container log, and paste it. 
3. Install the suggested plugins. Once done give the required details to complete the setup.
4. Once setup is done and you will land on the Jenkins homepage. 

### Launch one EC2 instance(**t2.micro** is sufficient) which acts as a __Jenkins Build Agent__:-

```shell
# Setup the environment

sudo su -
hostnamectl hostname Jenkins-Agent
echo "export PS1='\e[0;31m[\u@\h \w]\$ \e[m'" >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile

# Update the Packages

dnf update -y
dnf upgrade -y

# Install Java(Agent's Java version should match with Jenkins Master Java Version)

dnf list | grep -i java-    # Identify the package to install
dnf install -y java-17-amazon-corretto-devel.x86_64
java -version # To check the java version

# Create a user with jenkins as the name

useradd jenkins
passwd jenkins # Change the password for jenkins user
mkdir -p /opt/jenkins # We'll use this directory as Remote root directory for Jenkins agent
chown -R jenkins:jenkins /opt/jenkins

# Use visudo command(sometimes gives problem), so directly edit /etc/sudoers file.

vi /etc/sudoers  # Add below line after %wheel entry(mostly at line 108 in /etc/sudoers file)

jenkins  ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL

# To enable the Password authentication execute below in sshd_config file

sed -i s/'PasswordAuthentication no'/'PasswordAuthentication yes'/g /etc/ssh/sshd_config
grep -i 'PasswordAuthentication' /etc/ssh/sshd_config # It should show yes, Otherwise we'll get authentication errors.

systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd

# exit and relogin again using jenkins user

exit

sudo su -
echo "export PS1='\e[0;32m[\u@\h \w]\$ \e[m'" >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile
```

### For setting EC2 Instance as Jenkins Build Agent follow the below steps inside a Jenkins container:

`docker ps`

`docker exec -it <docker-container-id> bash`

```shell
cd
ssh-keygen  # Don't give anything, just leave it to defaults

# Above command will generate Public Key(id_rsa.pub) and Private key(id_rsa) under ~/.ssh folder.

cd ~/.ssh
ssh-copy-id jenkins@[public-ip of ec2 agent node] # It'll prompt for the password of remote host jenkins user, Please provide.

#Once public key is copied, please check below on EC2 agent node

cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
> Now Password-less authentication is enabled between Jenkins Master and Jenkins EC2 Agent.

### Now add the EC2 Agent in Jenkins using Jenkins management console.

* First create a global credential by going to Manage Jenkins -> Credentials -> global -> Add Credentials.
    - Kind: SSH Username with private key
    - ID: ec2-agent
    - Username: **jenkins** `# Use the ec2 agent instance username.`
        - Key: <Copy the id_rsa(Private key) value which was created in in Jenkins master ~/.ssh/id_rsa file content>

* Manage Jenkins -> Nodes -> New Node

    - **Node Name**: ec2-java-build-agent-01 and select Permanant Agent and then select **Create**
    - Number of executors: 2
    - Remote root directory: `/opt/jenkins/`
    - Labels: java-agent-01
    - Usage: Use this node as much as possible
    - Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
        - Host: Public-ip of ec2 instance
    - Credentials: <select which you created>
    - Host Key Verification Strategy
